    <h1>My Goals</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Why do I want to learn this skill?</h3></li>
        <p>
        It means a lot to me. I really wanted to pursue my passion and I want to achieved doing
        things that I love and one of those things is programming. My motivations are my family, continuing
        to challenge my capabilities and learning abilities. I will prove to myself that I can do this 
        and I can reach this goal and go beyond. I will try to find a better job with great environment
        for me to grow and master these skills that I will acquire in this learning process.
        </p>
        <li><h3>What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</h3></li>
        <p>There's a lot of doors will be open for me in this field. Specially that the world are going this path.
        Computer Engineering, Full Stack Web Development, Data Analyst/Engineer/Scientist or even Games/App Developer.
        There's a big chance to learn more since all the resources are available on the internet, I could learn more while working
        or even when I'm traveling while working.
        </p>
        <li><h3>How will this skill change my life and my career?</h3></li>
        <p>
            I will look for an environment that suits these skills that I will acquire. Find a place to settle down
            and I wanted to immigrate to either Canada or Australia and working with a job related to these skills. Where more opportunities,
            and room for growth is available. Not to mention the salary are well compensated too.
        </p>
        <li><h3>How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family, friends and coworkers?</h3></li>
        <p>
            I will be able to provide a brighter future to my daughter and to my wife. I can work with flexibility in my time and can work
            from home. I don't mind what others think of me when I acquired these skills, the only competition I have is with my old self.
            I am seeking to be better than myself yesterday.
        </p>
        <li><h3>How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</h3></li>
        <p>
            I will feel disappointed for sure. But being stuck and regretting something will not help me achieve my goals.
            Instead, I will <strong>keep moving forward</strong>.
        </p>
        <li><h3>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?</h3></li>
        <p>
            I'm visualizing that I am working from home, with the flexibility of my time, with a company that have great environment. Still continuing
            to learn and progress the skill that I acquired. Having a balance life and work. Enjoying my life together with my wife and daughter.
            Serving the Lord in a place that we choose and dreamed to settle down as immigrants.
